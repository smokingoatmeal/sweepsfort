</div>

    <h2 id="Section1">Overview</h2>

<p>You may or may not have heard about Luckyland’s fantastic Diamond Duck program. It’s a relatively new VIP system with some very nice rewards that reset every month. Unlike most VIP programs that operate this way, <em>you will actually be happy when this one resets</em>, because you are able to repeat the process and <strong>receive the rewards all over again</strong> each time!</p>

<p>With the proper strategy, most players can realistically achieve the <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>yellow</strong> tiers each month. Blue tier will unlock a $0.99 pack that comes with 60k gold and 30 SC; yellow tier will unlock a pack that comes with 100k gold and 50 SC. Do you want <strong>80 SC for $1.98 every month</strong>? Yeah, I thought so!</p>

<p>Also, Luckyland usually runs a couple of extra Quacky hours that are only available to players who have achieved at least blue tier in the Diamond Duck program.</p>

<p>However, Luckyland has not provided much concrete information regarding the exact inner workings of the program, so players have been forced to learn how to advance via good old fashioned trial and error. Fortunately for you, <strong>we’ve already done the hard work</strong> and put together this guide, to help you get a jump start!</p>

<p><strong>Read on to become a Diamond Duck expert!</strong></p>


    <h2 id="Section2">The Rewards</h2>

<p>The Diamond Duck program offers a number of rewards to players who achieve Diamond Duck status. The rewards are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Special <em>*massive*</em> discount coin packs, that can be bought once each time a player unlocks a new tier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what those currently look like:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-blue-yellow-pink-sale-packages.webp" alt="Blue, Yellow, Pink reward tiers" />
</div>

<p><em>The first 3 tiers</em></p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-orange-red-midnight-radiant-sale-bundles.webp" alt="Orange, Red, Midnight, Radiant reward tiers" />
</div>

<p><em>The final 4 tiers</em></p>
<br></br>
<ul>
  <li>Special ‘Diamond Duck Only’ Quacky Hour sales each month, on top of the regular quacky hour sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of a recent ‘Diamond Duck Only’ Quacky Hour sale:</p>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Premium Support
    <ul>
      <li>I haven’t really needed to reach out to Luckyland’s support, so I don’t have much insight as to how much better this is.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Exclusive Games
    <ul>
      <li>Each month, there are a couple of new games that are only available to players who have achieved diamond duck status.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Events
    <ul>
      <li>I believe this is still a work in progress. I have not seen events yet that were clearly defined as Diamond Duck exclusive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Section3">The Process</h2>

<p>Now that you understand the rewards, you’re probably anxious to learn how to unlock them right?</p>

<p>Let’s get started Duckies!!!</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/donald-duck-counting-money.gif" alt="description" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
</div>

<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>There are 7 tiers of Diamond Duck status, as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blue -> Yellow -> Pink -> Orange -> Red -> Midnight -> Radiant</strong></p>

<p>Each tier is significantly more difficult to unlock compared to the previous tier, and comes with a larger one-time discount coin pack. <em>(*One time each month that you unlock it, that is!)</em></p>

<p><strong>For most players, going after the blue and yellow tiers each month will provide the best balance of effort and reward.</strong> After yellow, you will need to dedicate some serious time and effort (and likely purchase additional coin packs) if you want to progress to the pink and higher tiers.</p>

<p>Diamond Duck status is achieved by playing games on Luckyland Slots. Both gold coin play and sweeps coin play progress your status. Given that it takes quite a lot of play to complete a tier, it generally makes the most sense to do this with gold coin play.</p>

<p>What is critically important to understand, is that <strong>bet size appears to have no impact</strong> on your progress. Your advancement is driven purely by the number of spins, bets, or plays that you make. What does this mean? It means that it makes sense to do the lowest bet size possible, for efficiency (to waste as little gold as possible.)</p>

<p>As you play games, note the diamond icon in between your duck avatar and the “Buy” button at the top of the screen:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-rewards-blue-diamond-progress.webp" alt="Diamond icon progress example" />
</div>

<p>This diamond will sparkle as you play, and it will gradually fill up with a color that represents the tier you are currently working toward. Each time the diamond completely fills up, the percentage shown underneath it will increase by 1.</p>

<p>When you hit 100%, you have reached that tier, and unlocked your reward pack:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/blue-diamond-duck-discount-bundle-luckyland.webp" alt="Blue Diamond tier reached screen" />
</div>

<p><strong>Congratulations, you did it!!!</strong></p>



    <h2 id="Section4">Recommended Games</h2>

<p>For achieving Diamond Duck status, not all games are created equal.</p>

<p>You are going to want to <strong>conserve your gold</strong>, so that you can advance to the highest tier possible. Also, when you are done for the month, the gold you have managed to keep will be <strong>extremely valuable</strong> when you repeat this process next month.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 3 games that seem to work best:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Luckyland 7s</li>
  <li>The Great Pigsby</li>
  <li>Starspell</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, we will go over the pros and cons of using each of these games.</p>

<h3>Luckyland 7s (LL7 for short)</h3>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-logo-slot-machine-vegas-theme.webp" alt="Luckyland 7s game screenshot" />
</div>

<p><strong>Minimum Bet Size:</strong> 250 GC<br>
<strong>Speed:</strong> Fast</p>

<p>This one’s an old-school 3-reel slot. It may not look like much, but it’s an absolute killer for Diamond Duck. The minimum bet size is fairly low at 250 gold per spin, which is good for our purposes. While variance is always a factor, LL7 tends not to burn gold fast. Also, LL7 does not require constant user interaction – it will not stop after a free spin, or wait for you to click.</p>

<p>Based on our experience, by playing LL7 it will take you about 16–18 hours to achieve the first tier (Blue Duck), and about 90–94 hours to achieve the second tier (Yellow Duck.)</p>

<h3>The Great Pigsby (Pigsby for short)</h3>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/great-pigsby-slot-relax-gaming-luckyland.webp" alt="The Great Pigsby game screenshot" />
</div>

<p><strong>Minimum Bet Size:</strong> 10,000 GC<br>
<strong>Speed:</strong> Medium</p>

<p>Pigsby is a newer offering on Luckyland. It’s a very solid game, and some players are experimenting with using it to chase Diamond Duck status. Like LL7, Pigsby is generally great at conserving your gold. It also features an unlimited autoplay (just click the + in the autoplay menu until the spins count changes to an infinity symbol) and the game will continue to run for hours without player intervention.</p>

<p>There are two significant drawbacks to Pigsby that we should point out, however:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The minimum bet size is 10,000 GC. This is not ideal for our purposes, and it does likely mean that you will want to have more gold to start with, to be able to weather any long losing streaks.</li>
  <li>Pigsby is a game with a relatively high frequency of free spin rounds. When you trigger the 10 free spins, you are losing time, because unpaid spins don’t count toward your diamond duck progress. So every time a free spins round triggers, the whole time those 10 spins are running, that is dead time.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have not tested enough with Pigsby yet to quantify how long it takes to reach various tiers of Diamond Duck using this game. However, we have heard enough positive feedback from players using it to justify including it here.</p>

<h3>StarSpell</h3>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/star-spell-slot-casino-magic-theme.webp" alt="StarSpell game screenshot" />
</div>

<p><strong>Minimum Bet Size:</strong> 1,000 GC<br>
<strong>Speed:</strong> Breaking the sound barrier</p>

<p>StarSpell is an interesting game. It features a burst mode, which goes insanely fast. Starspell is by far the fastest option we are aware of for earning Diamond Duck tiers. However, there are a couple of drawbacks to using StarSpell.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>StarSpell will burn through gold fairly quickly</strong>, unless you get lucky. There is significant volatility at play here!</li>
  <li><strong>StarSpell is incredibly popular</strong> and there are sometimes issues with the game timing out. This is especially pronounced earlier in a month, when many players are all trying to play this game to tier up in Diamond Duck.</li>
</ul>

<p>I only recommend StarSpell in two specific situations. First, if you have an absolutely ridiculous amount of gold (we have seen players with 100 million gold for example) – then you may simply not care that much about efficiency, and in that case StarSpell makes plenty of sense.</p>

<p>Second, if you want to pursue the higher tiers of Diamond Duck, a game with burst mode becomes nearly the only viable way to do so. You simply can’t complete enough spins with LL7 or Pigsby in a month, to hit the highest tiers. Pink is technically possible to achieve with LL7, but it will become a full-time job. <strong>Orange and up are likely not possible without a burst mode game.</strong></p>



   <h2 id="Section5">Tips for Amassing Gold</h2>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/scrooge-mcduck-diving-coins-rich.gif" alt="Scrooge McDuck diving into gold" />
</div>

<p>When you start chasing Diamond Duck tiers every month, you are going to quickly realize that building up a lot of gold is <strong>essential</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of ways to channel your inner Scrooge McDuck and hoard gold like a dragon sleeping under a mountain.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Click that Collect Button!!!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Luckyland offers you free gold <strong>every 4 hours</strong>. At the bottom right of the screen, there is an icon that rotates between a pink collect gold button, and a blue collect SC button. Every time the timer reaches zero on the pink one, you can collect gold by clicking it:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-hourly-bonus-countdown.webp" alt="Luckyland 4-hour gold bonus button" />
</div>
<p>The amount of gold you get will be determined by your level (a separate system from the Diamond Duck program.) You can check your level by clicking on the duck icon at the top left of your screen in Luckyland:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-yellow-diamond-duck-icon.webp" alt="Duck icon location on screen" />
</div>

<p>The screen that pops up will show your current level:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-yellow-diamond-level-78-vip-badge.webp" alt="Yellow Diamond level display" />
</div>

<p>Initially, new players receive <strong>1,000 gold per click</strong>. This increases to <strong>7,000 gold</strong> per click at level 50, and <strong>15,000 gold</strong> per click at level 100!</p>

<p><em>You will level up automatically as you play games, so don’t worry if it’s low right now – after doing the Diamond Duck chase a few times your level (and thus gold per collect) will increase. Your level, unlike your Diamond Duck tier, does not reset.</em></p>

<h3>Buying Quacky Hour Sales</h3>

<p>In addition to the SC, Quacky Hour sales include a lot of gold. Buying these makes a lot of sense, because you are generally getting 100% bonus in terms of SC, AND you are getting a bunch of gold to keep fueling your Diamond Duck run. I generally score several hundred thousand to a million gold every month, just from buying the Quacky Hours!</p>

<p>Here is an example of a recent Quacky Hour deal:</p>

<div class="image-grid">
  <img src="images/luckyland-quacky-hour-promo-100k-sc-deal.webp" alt="Quacky Hour gold and SC bonus example" />
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Buying the Diamond Duck Reward Packs</strong><br />
    When you unlock a tier in the Diamond Duck program, they offer you a sweet reward pack. For example, unlocking Blue Diamond currently grants you access to a pack that costs $0.99 and comes with 60k gold and 30 SC. Buying these packs will further replenish your gold stash.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Buying Regular Coin Packs</strong><br />
    You can always buy coin packs in the regular Luckyland store to top up your gold. However, if you follow this guide, this is generally not <em>necessary</em> unless you are chasing a really high Diamond Duck tier.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Special Events and Promos</strong><br />
    Luckyland periodically does special events, such as scavenger hunts (where they give you a hint and you need to find the game they are talking about, then when you open the game you get SC and gold as a reward.) They also sometimes do straight up freebies, where they just give you SC and gold. Watch out for these! Which brings me to my next point…
