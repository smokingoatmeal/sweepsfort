        <p>This is a brief guide that covers the basic concepts involved in writing mail-in entries to sweepstakes sites. Please note that we also have a guide to recommended supplies here:

        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>AMOE Overview</h2>
        <p>Many sweepstakes sites offer an Alternative Method of Entry (or AMOE) process, where you can mail in requests for free Sweepstakes Coins (SC.) If your entry meets the required criteria, as specified in the site’s Sweepstakes Rules, they will issue you free SC.</p>
        <p>If you want to try this out, the process is fairly straight-forward. For the site you are interested in sending AMOE entries to, you need to navigate to the 'Sweepstakes Rules' page or document. Sometimes the name of this will vary, such as 'Sweeps Rules,' 'Sweeps Policy,' or a similar phrase. A link to this is usually located at the bottom of the sweepstakes website; on some sites you will need to be logged in to see it. </p>
        <p>Once you find the sweepstakes rules, you need to locate the section that discusses alternative method of entry. Searching (ctrl-f in most browsers on Windows) for terms like 'written' or 'alternative method' will generally get you to this section quickly. Read this section carefully, and note all of the details. Mail-in entries are strict! Making mistakes on the envelope or card, or using incorrect materials will generally void your entry. </p>
        <h3>Key things to note are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>How much SC will be credited for each entry?</strong></li>
          <p>This is incredibly important! Some sites offer a very small credit, such as .75 or 1 SC per entry. A stamp currently costs $0.73, and you will spend a few cents on the envelope and paper or index card. You will need to periodically buy new pens and white-out tape, and let's not forget the time and effort aspect - it will typically take you a few minutes to write out each entry. So... do the math and choose carefully!</p>
          <p></p>
          <li><strong>What materials must be used for entries?</strong></li>
          <p>Commonly this will be #10 envelopes and blank unlined 4x6 paper or index cards, but you need to check - there are some exceptions. Also note any rules regarding ink color - many sites state that you must use non-black ink, for example. (On the other hand, some REQUIRE blank ink, so again, make sure you check the rules!)</p>
          <p></p>
          <li><strong>Are there any limits on entries?</strong></li>
          <p>Most do not state one, but a few do. You need to be aware of any limits.</p>
          <p></p>
          <li><strong>How/where do you generate the unique code for each entry?</strong></li>
          <p>Most sites require you to generate a unique code and write it onto each individual entry. The rules will tell you how and where to generate these codes.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>PAY EXTREMELY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT INFORMATION THEY TELL YOU TO PUT ON THE ENVELOPE AND CARD!</strong></p>
        <p>Many sites do not require you to write your name above your return address on the envelope. Some do, however. Most sites require your name written on the card to match your name as it appears on the ID that you used to verify your identity with them when you signed up (this may mean including your middle name for example.) Some will state something different, such as only use your first and last name. READ THE RULES REALLY CAREFULLY, AND FOLLOW THEM EXACTLY! </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you are verified before sending AMOE entries to a site. Some sites will not accept AMOE entries until you are verified, and none will allow you to redeem any winnings until you are verified. Do this FIRST! You will generally need to submit an ID, a selfie photo, and documents to verify your address and bank account.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Work on your handwriting - common mistakes include poor spacing, poor structure of the ‘loop’ on certain letters like e, d, and g, and making the ‘tails’ too long on letters like y. If you make the loop too small on e, it can look like a c. If you write a d poorly, it can be read as ‘ol’ rather than d. Also, make sure your handwriting is clear and legible, and not too small. There will be some trial and error in the beginning.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>People do not write things by hand nearly as much nowadays as they once did. It will probably feel a bit awkward at first. Relax - that is totally normal. In time, you will get used to it, and your writing will improve..</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Do not try to write too fast. Take your time. Don’t grip the pen too hard, and don’t press down too hard, as doing either will tire your hands out and make them sore.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Ensure you have a comfortable area to write. You can work from a desk or table, or use a lap desk to work from a couch or other comfortable chair. Make sure you have good posture, don’t hunch over or strain your neck while writing..</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Experiment with putting a piece of cardboard or a magazine under the index card or 4x6 paper that you are writing on. See if you like this better compared to just having the card or 4x6 paper directly on your desk.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>The unique codes that most sites require you to write on each entry may expire. In fact, they expire for most sites. The rules will tell you when these codes expire. In general, do not pull a ton of codes and save them up for a long time, or you run the risk of using an expired code.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Make a template for each site you write to. That is, write out one entry card or paper, and one envelope, then keep that aside as your model, and use it for reference when you write entries to that site.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>It is generally more efficient to break the process down into stages. For example, some people write out all of the envelopes, then write out all of the cards, then stuff all of the cards into the envelopes and seal them, then finally apply stamps to each of the letters they have written in a session.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Never use pre-stamped envelopes! ALWAYS apply the stamp LAST. If you make a mistake on an envelope and it is already stamped, it becomes about a $0.76 mistake, rather than a $0.03 mistake.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Keep track of everything in a spreadsheet. You will want to know how many letters you sent to a given site, and on what date. Later on, this information will be invaluable when you begin to receive credits; you can begin to determine about how long it is taking from the time you send to the time you receive credits, and you can estimate whether any of your entries are getting rejected.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Periodically check the sweepstakes rules and ensure that your template matches the content required, as specified in the rules, EXACTLY. Sites can and do occasionally adjust the requirements! If you log into a site and get a prompt about an update to the rules this is 100% a sign that you better check your template against the updated rules.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Don’t believe everything you may hear about writing to a particular site. Unfortunately, some letter writers seek to discourage others from writing. If you hear something negative, double check with people you trust before assuming the information is accurate.</li>
          <p></p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <h4>Q: How many requests can I send in to a sweepstakes site for free SC?</h4>
          <p2>A: For the most part there is no definitive answer. A few sites clearly state a limit (for example, at the time of this writing, Clubs Poker states that no more than 50 entries per month will be accepted.) Golden Hearts allows you to SEND as many as you want, but you will only be able to enter one code (using the cards they send back to you) per day. However, with most sites it is ambiguous</p2>
          <h4>Q: How long does it take to receive SC credits for mail-in entries?</h4>
          <p2>A: This varies widely, and changes over time. Currently, many sites take about 2-3 months to credit mail-in entries. However, there are some sites taking as long as a year to issue credit for letters. Your best bet is to ask in the amoe channel of the discord, and other members can let you know what lead times they are currently experiencing for a particular site.</p2>
          <h4>Q: What is a good site to start with?</h4>
          <p2>A: Golden Hearts is a pretty good one to start with as a beginner. They are one of the faster turn-around options, and when you first start writing AMOE entries, getting feedback early on is important.</p2>
          <h4>Q: How long does it take to write an AMOE entry?</h4>
          <p2>A: This is going to be different for everyone. In the beginning it will be slower; over time you will get better at it and become more efficient if you do this a lot. A good general estimate is that it will take the average person about 3-5 minutes per mail-in entry - keep in mind you need to obtain a unique code, fill out both the envelope and the card or 4x6 paper, stuff the card in the envelope and seal it, apply the stamp, and update your documentation.</p2>
          <h4>Q: Can I hire a legion of workers to write letters for me? Or print them in a font that looks like handwriting?</h4>
          <p2>A: NO! These sites are very sophisticated. They use complex scanning equipment to read your entries, and they detect if handwriting does not match previous entries or appears to be machine-generated. That is a ticket to ban city, population: you.</p2>
